# DT_Shielding_Lab66
This repository contains the simulation of the DTSource in Lab66, where it is surrounded by cylindercal water tanks containing borated water. Previously the geometry only consists of cubical water tanks. 

  In my local computer, it is located at /Users/pratyushpatel/IronFilter/DTShielding_Lab and in the ghpcc site this can be found inside /home/pp59a/Filter_lab_realistic_settings_cylinder/DT_Shielding_Lab66
